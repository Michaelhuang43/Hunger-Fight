    <p>Our school and schools around the world have recently joined forces to fight against world hunger. The office for the Fight Against World Hunger team is located next to the bookstore. You can drop off food and money donations there. We also have donation drop-off locations at participating grocery stores. See the list of stores as well as additional information on the bulletin board outside our team office.</p>
